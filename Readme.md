This is about the Simulate Voodoo's Donut Demand assignment.

Firstly I defined all the locations and added properties to each of them

For example:
var Downtown={
        HoursOfOperation : 11,//from 7a-6p, operation hour is 11
        HourlyFootTraffic : Math.floor(Math.random() * 141 + 80),  //randomize a number from hourly foot traffic range
        PercentEntering : 0.1,
        NumberOfDonutsOrderdPerEnt:4
   }; 

   For the var HoursOfOperation, it is from 7am-5am, which is 11 hours;
   For the var HourlyFootTraffic, it will be a random number from a certain range, I put "Math.random()"on it and make sure the number output from this range. 
   Both vars HourlyFootTraffic and PercentEntering may have decimal numbers, I put a "Math.floor" to make them integers.

   Secondly, I was told that Hourly foot traffic should be randomly selected from the range provided, for each hour of the day, which means I should not just multiple the HoursOfOperation by NumberOFDonutsForEveryHour, I have to add a for loop and make a random sum to output the TotalNumbersOfDonutsForWholeDay.
   Here it is:
   for(i=0;i<12;i++) {
        NumberOFDonutsForEveryHour1 = Math.floor(Downtown.HourlyFootTraffic * (Downtown.PercentEntering) * Downtown.NumberOfDonutsOrderdPerEnt);
        TotalNumbersOfDonutsForWholeDay1 = i * NumberOFDonutsForEveryHour1;
    }

    Lastly, output both NumberOFDonutsForEveryHour and TotalNumbersOfDonutsForWholeDay.
